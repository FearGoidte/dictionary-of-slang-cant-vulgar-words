      <p> WALKER! or  hookey walker  ! an ejaculation of incredulity, said when a person is telling a story which you know to be all gammon, or false. The  Saturday Reviewer's  explanation of the phrase is this:—" Years ago, there was a person named  Walker,  an aquiline-nosed Jew, who exhibited an orrery, which he called by the erudite name of  Eidoura-nion.  He was also a popular lecturer on astronomy, and often invited his pupils, telescope in hand, to  take a sight at the moon and stars. The lecturer's phrase struck his school-boy auditory, who frequently "took a sight" with that gesture of outstretched arm. and adjustment to nose and eye, which was the first garnish of the popular saying. The next step was to assume phrase and gesture as the outward and visible mode of knowingness in general." A correspondent, however, denies this, and states that  hooket WALKER was a magistrate of dreaded acuteness and incredulity, whose hooked nose gave the title of  beak  to all his successors; and, moreover, that the gesture of applying the thumb to the nose and agitating the little finger, as an expression of "Don't you wish you may get it ?" is considerably older than the story in the  Saturday Review  would seem to indicate. There is a third explanation of  hooket WALKER in  Notes and Queries,  iv., 425.</p>

      <p> SOME ACCOUNT OF THE</p>
      <p> BACK   SLANG,</p>
      <p> THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF COSTERMONGERS.</p>
      <p> The  costermongers of London number between thirty and forty thousand. Like other low tribes, they boast a language, or secret tongue, in which they hide their earnings, movements, and other private affairs. This costers' speech, as Mayhew remarks, offers no new fact, or approach to a fact, for philologists; it is not very remarkable for originality of construction; neither is it spiced with low humour, as other cant. But the costermongers boast that it is known only to themselves; that it is far beyond the Irish, and puzzles the Jews.</p>
      <p> The main principle of this language is spelling the words backwards, — or rather^ pronouncing them rudely backwards.  Sometimes, for the sake of harmony, an extra syllable is prefixed, or annexed; and, occasionally, the word is given quite a diffq-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-252"/>
      <p> rent turn in rendering it backwards, from what an uninitiated person would have expected. One coster told Mayhew that he often gave the end of a word '* a new turn, just as if he chorussed it with a tol-de-rol." Besides, the coster has his own idea of the proper  way of spelling words, and is not to be convinced but by an overwhelming show of learning, —and frequently not then, for he is a very headstrong fellow. By the time a coster has spelt an ordinary word of two or three syllables in the proper way, and then spelt it backwards, it has become a tangled knot that no etymologist could unravel. The word  generalise,  for instance, is considered to be " shilling" spelt backwards. Sometimes Slang and Cant words are introduced, and even these, when imagined to be tolerably well known, are pronounced backwards. Other terms, such as GEN, a shilling, and FLATCH, a halfpenny, help to confuse the outsider.</p>
      <p> After a time, this back language,  ovt  BACK-SLANG, as it is called by the costermongers themselves, comes to be regarded by the rising generation of street sellers as a distinct and regular mode of speech. They never refer words, by inverting them, to their originals; and the  TENEPS  and ES-CLOPS, and NAMOWS, are looked upon as proper, but secret terms. " But it is a curious fact, that lads who become costermongers' boys, without previous association with the class, acquire a very ready</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-253"/>
      <p> command of the language, and this though they are not only unable to spell, but ' don't know a letter in a book,*' " They soon obtain a considerable stock vocabulary, so that they converse rather from the memory than the understanding. Amongst the senior costermongers, and those who pride themselves on their proficiency in  back-slang,  a conversation is often sustained for a whole evening, especially if any " flatties" are present whom they wish to astonish or confuse. The women use it sparingly, but the girls are generally well acquainted with it.</p>
      <p> The addition of an  s,  I should state, always forms the plural, so that this is another source of complication.    For instance,  woman  in the  back-</p>
      <p> SLANG,   is   NAMOW,   and   NAMUS,  Or   NAMOWS,   is</p>
      <p> women,  not  NEMOW.  The explorer, then, in undoing the BACK-SLANG, and turning the word  namus once more into English, would have  suman, —a novel am^ very extraordinary rendering of  women. Where a word is refractory in submitting to a back rendering, as in the case of  pound,  letters are made to change positions for the sake of harmony; thus, we have  dunop,  a pound, instead of  dmiop which nobody could pleasantly pronounce. This will remind the reader of the Jews'  '■'old do! old do r  instead of  old dothes, old dollies,  which would tire even the patience of a Jew to repeat all day.</p>

      <p> 254:     THE BACK SLANG UNKNOWN TO THE POLICE.</p>
      <p> This sincrular BACK tono-ue has been in vojnie about twenty-five years. It is, as before stated, soon acquired, and is principally used by the coster-mongers (as the specimen Glossary will show), for communicating the secrets of their street tradings, the cost and profit of the goods, and for keeping their natural enemies, the police, in the dark. CoOL THE ESCLOP (look at the police) is often said amongst them, when one of the constabidary makes his appearance.</p>
      <p> Perhaps on no subject is the costermonger so particular as on money matters. All costs and profits he thinks should be kept profoundly secret. The Back Slang, therefore, gives the various small amounts very minutely.</p>
      <p> FLATCH, halfpenny.</p>
      <p> YENEP, penny.</p>
      <p> OWT-YENEPS, twopence.</p>
      <p> ERTH-YENEPS, threepence.</p>
      <p> ROUF-YENEPS, fourpence.   *</p>
      <p> EVIF, or EWIF-YEXEPS, fivepence.</p>
      <p> EXIS-YENEPS, sixpence.</p>
      <p> NEVIS-YENEPS, sevenpence.</p>

      <p> The GENS continue in the same sequence as the TENEPS above, excepting  theg-gens, 8s.,  which is usually rendered  theg-guy, —a deviation with ample precedents in all civihsed tongues.</p>
      <p> YENORK, a crown piece, or five shillings. FLATCH-YENORK, half a-crown.</p>
      <p> Beyond this amount the costermonger reckons after an intricate and complicated mode. Fifteen shillings would be  erth-evif-gens,  or, literally, three times 5s.; seventeen shillings would be  erth-yenork-flatch,  or three crowns and a half; or, by another mode of reckoning,  erth-evif-gens FLATCH-YENORK,  i.e.,  three times 5s., and half-a-crowi^</p>
      <p> DUNOP, a pound.</p>
      <p> Further than which the costermonger seldom goes in money reckoning.</p>
      <p> In the following Glossary only those words are given which costermongers principally use,—the terms connected with street traffic, the names of the different coins, vegetables, fruit and fish, technicalities of police courts, &amp;c.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-256"/>
      <p> The reader might naturally think that a system of speech so simple as the  back-SLANG  would require no Glossary; but he will quickly perceive, from the specimens given, that a great many words in frequent use in a  back  sense, have become so twisted as to require a little glossarial explanation.</p>

      <p> SOME ACCOUNT  OF   THE</p>
      <p> RHYMING   SLANG.</p>
      <p> THE  SECRET LA.NGUAGE  OF</p>
      <p> CHAUNTERS   AND   PATTERERS.</p>
      <p> There  exists in London a singular tribe of men, known amongst the "fraternity of vagabonds" as Qiaunters and Patterers. Both classes are great talkers. The first sing or chaunt through the public thoroughfares ballads—political and humorous — carols,  dying  speeches, and the various other kinds of gallows and street literature. The second deliver street orations on grease-removing compounds, plating powders, high polishing blacking, and the thousand and one wonderful pennyworths that are retailed to gaping mobs from a London kerb stone. They are quite a distinct tribe from the coster-mongers; indeed, amongst tramps, they term themselves the " harristocrats of the streets," and boast that they live by their intellects.    Like the coster-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-264"/>
      <p> mongers, however, they have a secret tongue or Cant speech, known only to each other. This Cant, which has nothing to do with that spoken by the costermongers, is known in Seven Dials and elsewhere as the EHYMING SLANG,  or tlie substitution of words and sentences which rhyme with other words intended to be kept secret.  The chaunter's Cant, therefore, partakes of his calling, and he transforms and uses up into a rough speech the various odds and ends of old songs, ballads, and street nick-names, which are found suitable to his purpose. Unlike nearly all other systems of Cant, the rhyming Slang is not founded upon allegory; unless we except a few rude similes, thus— i'm AFLOAT is the rhyming Cant for  boat^  SORROWFUL TALE is equivalent to  three months in jail,  artful DODGER signifies a  lodger,  and a  snake in the GRASS stands for a  looking-glass —a meaning that would delight a fat Chinaman, or a collector of Oriental proverbs. But, as in the case of the costers' speech and the old gipsey-vagabond Cant, the chaunters and patterers so interlard this rhyming Slang with their general remarks, while their ordinary language is so smothered and subdued, that, unless when they are professionally engaged and talking of their wares, they might almost pass for foreigners.</p>
      <p> From  the  inquiries  I  have  made   of various patterers and  "paper workers," I learn that the</p>

      <p> SPOKEIT PRINCIPALLY BY VAGABOND POETS.      265</p>
      <p> rhyming Slang was introduced about twelve or fifteen years ago. Numbering this class of oratorical and bawhng wanderers at twenty thousand, scattered over Great Britain, including London and the large provincial towns, we thus see the number of English vagabonds who converse in rhyme and talk poetry, although their habitations and mode of life constitute a very unpleasant Arcadia. These nomadic poets, like the other talkers of Cant or secret languages, are stamped with the vagabond's mark, and are continually on the move. The married men mostly have lodgings in London, and come and go as occasion may require. A few never quit London streets, but the greater number tramp to all the large provincial fairs, and prefer the  monkery  (country) to town life. Some transact their business in a systematic way, sending a post-office order to the Seven Dials printer, for a fresh supply of ballads or penny books, or to the  swag shop,  as the case may be, for trinkets and gewgaws, to be sent on by rail to a given town by the time they shaU arrive there.</p>
      <p> When any dreadful murder, colliery explosion, or frightful railway accident has happened in a country district, three or four chaunters are generally on the spot in a day or two after the occurrence, vending and bawhng "^  I'rue and Faithful Account,^*  &amp;c., which " true and faithful account" was concocted purely in the imaginations of the</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-266"/>
      <p> successors of Catnach and Tommy Pitts,* behind the counters of their printing shops in Seven Diak. And but few fairs are held in any part of England without the patterer being punctually at his post, with his nostrums, or real gold rings (with the story of the wager laid by the gentleman—see  fawney BOUNCING, in the Dictionary), or save-alls for candlesticks, or paste which, when applied to the strop, makes the dullest razor keen enough to hack broom handles and sticks, and after that to have quite enough sharpness left for splitting hairs, or shaving them off the back of one of the clodhoppers' hands, looking on in amazement. And CHEAP JOHN, too, with his coarse jokes, and no end of six-bladed knives, and pocket-books, containing information for everybody, with pockets to hold money, and a pencil to write with in the bargain, and a van stuffed with the cheap productions of Sheffield and " Brummagem,"—he, too, is a patterer of the highest order, and visits fairs, and can hold a conversation in the rhyming Slang.</p>
      <p> Such is a rough description of the men who speak this jargon; and simple and ridiculous as the vulgar scheme of a rhyming Slang may appear, it must always be regarded as a curious fact in linguistic history. In order that the reader's patience may not  be   too  much taxed,  only  a</p>

      <p> PATTEKEES  "WELL  UP"  IN  STREET SLANG,     267</p>
      <p> selection of rhyming words has been given in the Glossary,—and these for the most part, as in the case of the back Slang, are the terms of everyday life, as used by this order of tramps and hucksters. It must not be supposed, however, that the chaunter or patterer confines himself entirely to this Slang when conveying secret intelligence. On the contrary, although he speaks not a " leash of languages," yet is he master of the beggars' Cant, and is thoroughly " up" in street Slang.

      <p> SLANG,   CANT,  AND VULGAR  LANGUAGE;</p>

      <p> LIST OF THE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN CONSULTED IN COMPILING THIS WORK,</p>
      <p> OOMPRISIKO  KBAR.lt   EVERY KNOWN TREATISE UPON THE SUBJECT.</p>
      <p> Slaxg  lias a literary history, the same as authorised language. More than one hundred works have treated upon the subject in one form or another,— a few devoting but a chapter, whilst many have given up their entire pages to expounding its history and use. Old Harman, a worthy man, who interested himself in suppressing and exposing vagabondism in the days of good Queen Bess, was the first to write upon the subject. Decker followed fifty years afterwards, but helped himself, evidently, to his predecessor's labours. Shakespere, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and Brome, each employed beggars' Cant as part of the machinery of their plays. Then came Head (who wrote  "The  English  Kogue," in   1G80) with a</p>
      <p> t2</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-276"/>
      <p> glossary of Cant words "used by the Gipseys." But it was only a reprint of what Decker had given sixty years before. About this time authorised dictionaries began to insert vulgar words, labelling them " Cant." The Jack Sheppards and Dick Turpins of the early and middle part of the last century made Cant popular, and many small works were published upon the subject. But it was Grose, burly, facetious Grose, who, in the year 1785, collected the scattered glossaries of Cant and secret words, and formed one large work, adding to it all the vulgar words and Slang terms used in his own day. I am aware that the indelicacy and extreme vulgarity of the work renders it a disgrace to its compiler, still we must admit that it is by far the most important work which has ever appeared on street or popular language; indeed, fi'om its pages every succeeding work has, up to the present time, drawn its contents. The great favilt of Grose's book consists in the author not contenting himself with Slang and Cant terras, but the inserting of every " smutty" and offensive word that could be raked out of the gutters of the streets. However, Harman and Grose are, after all, the only authors who have as yet treated the subject in an original manner, or have written on it from personal inquiry.</p>

The Museum copy of the  First Edilvju  is, I suspect, Grose's own copy, as it contains numenms manuscript additions which afterwards went to form tlie second edition. Ex-ceptinof the obscenities, it is really an extraordinary book, and displays grreat industry, if we cannot speak much of its morality. It is the well from which all the other authors—Duncombe, Caul-field, Clarke, Egan, &amp;o. &amp;c.—drew their vulvar outpourings, without in the least purifying what they had stolen.</p>

      <p> LIBER VAGATORUM : Der Betler Orden, 4to.</p>
      <p> The first edition of this book appears to have been printed at Augsburg, by Erhard Oglin, or Ocellus, about 1514,— a small quarto of twelve leaves. It was frequently reprinted at other places in Germany; and in 1523 there appeared an edition at Wittemberp, with a preface by Martin Luther, who says that the " Kolwelsche Sprach," the cant languajre of the beggars, comes from the Jews, as it contains miny Hebrew words, as anyone who understands that language may perceive. This book is divided into three parts, or sections; the first gives a special account of tho several orders of the " Fraternity of Vagabonds;" the second, simdry "  notabilia"  relating to the difTerent classes of beggars previously described: and the third consists of a " Eotwelsche Vocaljulary," or "Canting Dictionary." There is a long notice of the " Liber Vagatorum" in the " Wiemarisches Jahrbuch," lO'e, Band, 1S56. Mayhew, in his " London Labour," states that many of our cant words are derived from the Jew fences. It is singular that a similar statement should have been made by Martm Luther more than three centuries before.</p>

      <p> OPINIONS OP THE PRESS.</p>
      <p> " The author has spared no pains to make his little volume perfect, both by collecting original and unused material from costermongers, vagabonds, and tramps, and by consulting nearly all writers who have gone before. * » » The author divides  Slang  into  historical, fashionable, parliamentary, military and dandy, university, religious, legal, literary, theatrical, civic, money, tJiopkeepers' and workm,en's slang, —the  slang apologies for oatlis,  and the  slang of drunke)iness.  The Freemasonry of tramps and beggars, and the hieroglyphics they use, is an interesting part of vagabond history that requires, if possible, further investigation. « » ♦ His work is carefully and honestlv performed, and we hope that the writer will read our remarks [five fall columns] in a proper spirit, and, in the latest slang of the present hour, will</p>
      <p> " TAKE  IHBU on  HIS HEAD LIKE A BIRD."— AlllOUBUm.</p>
      <p> "  Extremely interesting. This little volume is evidently the result of a great  deal of labour, as all works must be that are, in the chief part, collected directly by the observation and care of the author: and this we believe is the case in the present instance. The author we suspect to bo identical with the publisher, and if so, he has had great opportunity by his possession of a large amount of scarce tracts, ballads, and street publications, of informing himself of the language of the vagabond portion of our population."— Leader.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-294"/>
      <p> " There is a certain amomit of interest in preserving the origin of slang words as a record of existing manners, and of those starange popular sayings which have a rapid and almost universal popularity, and then fade away as rapidly. The combinations of language in cant are often curious. The London Antiquary informs us that the cant for a public house at the present day  is  suck cassa, —pure Saxon and pure Spanish."—ScUMrrfaif  Revieic.</p>

It gives an introduction, long and occasionally amusing, but of not the least value in explaining to the  Eiujiish  reader the peculiarities of the work. The Globe  pointed out this sad defect in reviewing the present edition :—" The copy beside us," remarks the writer, " is apparently edited and published by Mr. Hotten, who gives a preface—which has the rare merit of explaining exactly what the ordinary English reader requires to know of satirical political poems, written in the Yankee dialect, touching the Mexican war, and the extension of the slave states—and of attempting to explain nothing else."— Globe,  Dec. 8, 1859.</p>

      <p> The Marchioness Broglia Solari was the natural grand-daughter of Lord Hyde Clarendon, and consequently one of the collateral branches of the Queens Mary and Ann, and their grand-father, the great Chancellor of England. She played an Important part in the French Revolution; was the friend of Emperors and Princes; was intimately acquainted with George the Fourth, Burke, Sheridan, Madame de Stael, the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, Sir H. Davy, Paganini, &amp;c., of most of whom she gives characteristic anecdotes. The Marchioness endured many troubles, was robbed of her fortune, and for some time obtained her living as an actress at the theatres of London and Dublin. This work was published by an intimate friend, and the entire impression (with the exception of  a,  few copies) passed into the hands of the family. It is believed that only 150 copies were printed.
