Away went the</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-186"/>

      <p> PANTILE, a hat. The term  pantile  is properly applied to the mould into which the sugar is poured which is afterwards known as "loaf sugar." Thus,  pantile,  from whence comes the phrase "a sugar-loaf hat," originally signified a tall, conical hat, in shape similar to that usually repi-esented as the head gear of a bandit.

      <div class="newpage" id="page-194"/>
      <p> ing game common at fairs, and generally practised by thimble riggers. It consists of a "garfer" or apiece of list doubled, and then folded up tight. The bet is made upon your asserting that you can, with a pin, "prick" the point at which the garter is doubled. The garter is then unfolded, and nine times out of ten you will find that you have been deceived, and that you pricked one of the false folds. The owner of the garter, I should state, holds the ends tightly with one band. This was, doubtless, originally a Gipsey game, and we are informed by  Brand  that it was much practised by the Gipseys in the time of  Shakespere.

      <p> Lord Bacon, however, used the word in a similar sense a century before. PULL, an advantage, or hold upon another;   " I've the  pull over you,"  i.e.,  you are in my power—perhaps an oblique allusion to the judicial sense.— See the following.

At all events, it is believed to have been first used in England as a cant word.</p>

      <p> *** This curious list of numerals in use among the Lon-don street folk is, strange as it may seem, derived from the Lingua Franca,  or bastard  Italian,  of the Mediterranean seaports, of which other examples may be found in the pages of this Dictionary.  Saltee,  the cant term used by the co.^termongers and others for a penny, is no other tHan the Italian,  soldo  (plural,  soldi),  and the numerals—as may be seen by the  Italian  equivalents—are a tolerably close imitation of the originals. After the number six, a curious variation occurs, which is peculiar to the Loudon cant, seven being reckoned as  say oney,  six-one,  say doob,  six-two  = 8, and so on.  Dacha,  I may remark, is perhaps from the Greek,  deka  {diKa),  ten, which, in the Constantinopolitau Lingua Franca,  is likely enough to have been substituted for the  Italian.  Madza,  is clearly the  Italian  mezza.  The origin of  beong  I have not been so fortunate as to discover, xinless it be the  Fiench,  bien,  the application of which to a shilling is not so evident; but amongst costermongers and other street folk, it is quite immaterial what foreign tongue contributes to their secret language. Providing the terms are unknown to the police and the public generally, they care not a rushlight whether the polite French, the gay Spaniards, or the cloudy Germans helped to swell their vocabulary. The numbers of low foreigners, however, dragging out a miserable existence in our crowded neighbourhoods, organ grinders and image sellers, foreigu seamen from the vessels in the river, and our own connection with Malta and the Ionian Isles, may explain, to a certain extent, the phenomenon of the.';e Southern phrases iu the mouths of costers and tramps.</p>

A Scotch correspondent, however, states that the phrase probably came from the workshop, and that amongst needle makers when the points and eyes are " heads and tails" (" heeds and thraws"), or in confusion, they are said to be  sixes and sevens,  because those numbers are the sizes most generally used, and in the course of manufacture have frequently to be distinguished.</p>

      <p> SNOB, a low, vulgar, or afifected person. Supposed to be from the nickname usually applied to a Crispin, or a maker of shoes; but believed by a writer in  Notes and Queries  to be a contraction of the  Latin,  sine obolo.  A more probable derivation, however, has just been forwarded by an ingenious correspondent. He supposes that  nobs,  i.e., Nohiles,  was appended iu lists to the names of persons of gentle birth, whilst those who had not that distinction were marked down as s.  nob.,  i.e., sine nobilitate,  without marks of gentility,—thus reversing its meaning. Another "word-twister" remarks that, as at college sons of nobleman wrote after their names in the admission lists,  Jil nob.,  son of a lord, and hence all young noblemen were called  nobs,  and what they did NOBBY, so those who imitated them would be called quasi-nobs, "  like a nob," which by a process of contraction would be shortened to  si-nob,  and then  snob,  one who pretends to be what he is not, and apes his betters. The short and expressive terms which many think fitly represent the three great estates of the realm,  nob, snob,  and  mob, were all originally slang words. The last has safely passed through the vulgar ordeal of the streets, and found respectable quarters in the standard dictionaries.</p>

      <p> STICK, " cut your  stick,"  be off, or go away; either simply equivalent to a recommendation to prepare a walking staff in readiness for a journey—in allusion to the Eastern custom of cutting a stick before setting out—or from the ancient mode of reckoning by notches or tallies on a stick. In Cornwall the peasantry tally sheaves of corn by cuts in a stick, reckoning by the score. C0T  tour stick  in this sense may meao to make your mark and pass on—and so realise the meaning of the phrase "  in the nick  (or notch) OF TIME." Sir J. Emerson Tennent, in  Notes and Queries (December, 1869), considers the phrase equivalent to " cutting the connection," and suggests a possible origin in the prophets breaking the staves of "Beauty" and " Bands,"— vide  Zech., xi., 10, 14.</p>

      <p> March, 1859. Sometimes amplified to  stunning joe BANKS ! when the expression is supposed to be in its most intense form.  Joe Banks  was a noted character in the last generation. He was the proprietor of a public-house in Dyott-street, Seven Dials, and afterwards, on the demolition of the Rookei"y, of another in Cranbournealley. His houses became well-known from their being the resort of the worst characters, at the same time that the strictest decorum was always maintained in them.  Joe Banks  also acquired a remarkable notoriety by acting as a medium betwixt thieves and their victims. Upon the proper payment to Joe, a watch or a snuff box would at any time be restored to its lawful owner—" no questions in any case being asked." The most daring depredators in London placed the fullest confidence in Joe, and it is believed (although the  Biographic Universelle  is quiet upon this point) that he never, in any instance, " sold" them. He was of the middle height, stout, and strongly made, and was always noted for a showy pin, and a remarkably STUNNING  neck-tie.  It was this peculiarity in the costume of Mr. Banks, coupled with those true and tried qualities as a friend, for which, as I have just remarked, he was famous, that led his customers to proclaim him as  stunning JOE  banks  ! The Marquis of Douro, Colonel Cbatterley, and men of their stamp, were accustomed to resort to a private room at his house, when too late or too early to gain admittance to the clubs or more aristocratic establishments.</p>
