      <p> "A cant word amongst the vulgar, by which is implied a dirty fellow of the meanest kind. Dr. Johnson says, and he cites only the modern authority of Swift. r&gt;ut the introduction of this word into our language belongs not to the vulgar, and is more than a century prior to the time of Swift. Mr. Malone agrees with me in exhibiting the two first of the following examples. The  hlack-gwird is evidently designed to imply a fit attendant on the devil. Mr. Gifford, however, in his late edition of Ben Jonson's works, assigns au origin of the name different from what the old examples which I have cited seem to countenance. It has been firmed, he saj-s, from those 'mean and dirty dependants, in great houses, who were selected to carry coals to the kitchen, halls, &amp;c. To this smutty regiment, who atteniled the progresses, and rode in the carts with the ppts and kettles, which, with every other article of furniture, were then moved from palace to palace, the people, iu derision, gave the name of  bluek guards;  a term since become sufficiently familiar, and never properly explained.'—lienJonson, ii. 1(&gt;9, vii. 250 "— 2'odd's Johnsoii's Dicliuiiary.</p>

      <p> BLOW ME, or  blow me tight,  a vow, a ridiculous and unmeaning ejaculation, inferring an appeal to the ejaculator; "I'm SLOWED if you will" is a common expression among the lower orders; " BLOW  me up  " was the term a century ago. — See Parker's Adventures,  1781.</p>

      <p> BLUE BLANKET, a rough over coat made of coarse pilot cloth.</p>
      <p> BLUE-BOTTLE, a policeman. It is singular that this well known slang term for a London constable should have been used by Shakespere.

      <p> BLUNT, money. It has been said that this term is from the French  blond,  saudy or golden colour, and that a parallel may be found in  brown  or  browns,  the slang for half-pence. The etymology seems far fetched, however,</p>
      <p> BLURT OUT, to speak from impulse, and without reflection.—</p>
      <p> Shakespere. BOB, a shilling.   Formerly  bobstick,  which may have been the</p>

      <p> BOBBY, a policeman. Both  bobby  and  peeler  were nicknames given to the new police, in allusion to the christian and surnames of tLe late  Sir Robert Peel,  who was the prime mover in effecting their introduction and improvement. The term  bobby  is,' however, older than the  Saturday Reviewer,  in bis childish and petulant remarks, imagines. The official square-keeper, who is always armed, with a cane to drive away idle and disorderly urchms, has, time out of mind, been called by the said urchins,  bobby  the Beadle.

      <p> BOOZE, to drink, or more properly, to use another slang term, to "lush," viz, to drink continually, until drunk, or nearly so. The term is an old one.

      <p> BORE, a troublesome friend or acquaintance, a nuisance, anything which wearies or annoys. The  Oradus ad Cantabrigiam suggests the derivation of  bore  from the  Greek, Bapos,  a burden.    Skakespere  uses it. King Henry VIII., i., 1—</p>
      <p> at this instant</p>
      <p> He BORES me with some trick."</p>
      <p> Grose  speaks of this word as being much in fashion about the year 1780-81, and states that it vanished of a sudden, without leaving a trace behind. Not so, burly Grose, the term is still in favour, and is as piquant and expressive as ever.     Of the modern sense of the word  bobe,  the Prince</p>

      <p> Consort made an amusing and efiTective use in his masterly address to the British Association, at Aberdeen, September 14, 1859.    He said (as reported by the  Times): —</p>
      <p> " I will not weary yon by further examples, with which most of yoo are better acquainted than I am myself^ but merely express my satisfaction that there should exist bodies of men who will bring the well-considered and understood wants of science before the public and the Government, who will even hand round the begfring-box, and expose themselves to refusils and rebufiFs, to which all beggars all liable, with the certainty besides of being considered great  sokes.  Please to recollect that this species of " bore " is a most useful animal, well adapted for the ends for which nature intended him. He alone, by constantly returning to the charge, and repeating the same truths and the same requests, succeeds in awakening attention to the cause which he advocates, and obtains that hearing which ia granted him at laat for self-protection, as the minor evil compared to his importunity, bat which is requisite to make his cause understood."</p>
      <p> BOSH, nonsense, stupidity.— Gipsey  and  Persian,  Also pure Turkish,  BOSH  lakerdi,  emi)ty talk. A person, iu the Saturday Review,  has stated that  bosh  is coeval with Morier's novel,  Hadji Babi,  which was published in 1828 ; but this is a blunder. The term was used in this country as early as 1760, and may be found in  the Student,  voL ii., p. 217.</p>
      <p> BOSH, a fiddle.</p>
      <p> BOSH-FAKER, a violin player.</p>

      <p> BOTHER, to teaze, to annoy.</p>
      <p> BOTHER (from the  Hibemicism  potheb),  trouble, or annoyance. Grose  has a singular derivation,  bother,  or  both-eared, from two persons talking at the same time, or to both ears. Blotheb,  an old word, signifying to chatter idly. —/See Halliwell.</p>

      <p> BOW-CATCHERS, or  kiss curls,  small curls twisted on the cheeks or temples of young—and often old —girls, adhering to the face as if gummed or pasted. Evidently a corruption of BEAU-CATCHERS. In old times these were called  love-locks,  when they were the marks at which all the puritan and ranting preachers levelled their pulpit pop-guns, loaded with sharp and virulent abuse. Hall and Pryune looked upon all women as strumpets who dared to let the hair depart from a straight line upon their cheeks. The French prettily term them  accroche-coeurs,  whilst in the United States they are plainly and unpleasantly called  spit- curls. Bartlett says:—"  Spit curl,  a detached lock of hair curled upon the temple; probably from having been at first filastered into shape bj^ the saliva. It is now understood that the mucilage of quince seed is used by the ladies for this purpose."</p>
      <p> " Yon may prate of your lips, and your teeth of pearl, And jour eyes so brightly flashing ; My song shall be of that  saliva cubl Which threatens my heart to smash in."</p>
      <p> Boston Tiuiiscnpt,  October 30,1858.</p>
      <p> When men twist the hair on each side of their faces into ropes they are sometimes called  bell-ropes,  as being wherewith to  draw the belles.  Whether  bell-ropes  or  bow-catchers, it is singular they should form part of the prisoner's paraphernalia, and that a jaunty little kiss-mc quick curl should, of all things in the world, ornament a gaol dock ; yet such was formerly the case. Htint, the murderer of Weare, on his trial, we are informed by  the Atlienceum,  appeared at the bar with a highly pomatumed lovelock sticking tight to his forehead.    Young ladies, think of this !</p>
      <p> BOWL-OUT, to put out of the game, to remove out of one's way, to detect.— Cricketing term.</p>

      <p> BROWN-STUDY, a revei-ie. Veiy common even in educated society, but hardly admissible in writing, and therefore mu=t be considered a vulgarism. It is derived, by a writer in  Notes and Queries,  from  brow  study, from the old German  bbaun,  or AUG-BRAUN, an eye-brow.— Ben Jonson.</p>
      <p> BROWN-TO, to understand, to comprehend.— American.</p>

      <p> BUCKLE, to bend; "I can't  buckle  to that," I don't understand it; to yield or give in to a person.  S.'iakespere  uses the word in the latter sense, Henry IV., i. 1; and  Halliwell  says that "the commentators do not supply another example." How strange that in our own streets the term should be used every day ! Stop the first costermonger, and he will soon inform you the various meaniugs of  buckle. — See Notes and Queries,  vols, vii,, viii., and ix.</p>
      <p> BUCKLE-TO, to bend to one's work, to begin at once, and with great energy.</p>

      <p> word for boasting, 1582. BUFF, the bare skin ; "stripped to the  bofp."</p>
      <p> BUFFER, a dog. Their skins were formerly in great request— hence the term,  buff  meaning in old English  to skin.  It is still used in the ring,  buffed  meaning stripped to the skin. In Irish cant,  buffer  is a  boxer.  The  buffer  of a railway carriage doubtless received its very appropriate name from the old pugilistic application of this term.</p>
      <p> BUFFER, a familiar expression for a jolly acquaintance, probably from the  French,  eouffard,  a fool or clown; a "jolly old BUFFER," said of a good humoured or liberal old man. In 1737, a  buffer  was a " rogue that killed good sound horses for the sake of their skins, by running a long wire into them."— Bacchus and Venus.

      <p> BUMMAREE. This term is given to a class of speculating salesmen at Billingsgate market, not recognised as such by the trade, but who get a living by buying large quantities of fish of the salesmen and re-selling it to smaller buyers. The word has been used in the statutes and bye-laws of the markets for upwards of 100 years. It has been variously derived, but is most probably from the  French,  bonne MABEE, good fresh fish ! "Mar^e signifie toute sorte de poisson de mer qiii n'est pas said; bonne marde— maree fraiche,  vendeur de marde,"— Diet, de I'Acad. Franc.  The BUMMAREES are accused of many trade tricks. One of them is to blow up cod-fish with a pipe until they look double their actual size. Of course when the fish come to table they are flabby, sunken, and half dwindled away. In Norwich, TO BUMMAREE ONE is to ruu up a scoi'c at a public house just open, and is equivalent to " running into debt with one."</p>

      <p> CAB, in statutory language, " a hackney carriage drawn by one horse." Abbreviated from  cabriolet,  French;  originally meaning " a light low chaise." The wags of Paris playing upon the word (quasi  cahri  au lait) used to call a superior turn-out of the kind a  cahri au creme.

A cloak with this name was in fashion in the year 1760. It received its title from its similarity in shape to one of the vestments of a cardinal.</p>

      <p> DANDY, a fop, or fashionable nondescript. This word, in the sense of a fop, is of modern origin.  Egan  says it was first used in 1820, and  Bee  in 1816.

The TIDY DODGE, as it is Called by street-folk, consists in dressing up a family clean and  tidy,  and parading the streets to excite compassion and obtain alms.

      <p> DONKEY, "three more and up goes the  donkey,"  a vulgar street phrase for extracting as much money as possible before performing any task.

      <p> FAST, gay, spreeish, unsteady, thoughtless,—an Americanism that has of late ascended from the streets to the drawing-room. The word has certainly now a distinct meaning, which it had not thirty years ago.  Quick  is the synonyme for  fast,  but a  quick man  would not convey the meaning of a FAST MAN,—a person who by late hours, gaiety, and continual rounds of pleasure, lives too fast and wears himself out. In polite society a  fast  young lady is one who afiects mannish habits, or makes herself conspicuous by some un-feminine accomplishment,—talks slang, drives about in London, smokes cigarettes, is knowing in dogs, horses, &amp;c. An amusing anecdote is told of a  fast  young lady, the daughter of a right reverend prelate, who was an adept in horseflesh.    Being desirous of ascertaining the opinion of a</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-138"/>
      <p> candidate for ordination, who had the look of a bird of the same feather, as to the merits of some cattle just brought to her father's palace for her to select from, she was assured by him they were utterly unfit for a lady's use. With a knowing look at the horses' points, she gave her decision in these choice words, " Well, I agree with you; they  are  a rum lot, as the Devil said of the ten commandments."</p>

      <p> FAWiSTEY, a finger ring.</p>
      <p> FAWNEY BOUNCING, selling rings for a wager. This practice is founded upon the old tale of a gentleman laying a wager that if he was to offer " real gold sovereigns " at a penny a piece at the foot of London Bridge, the English public would be too incredulous to buy. The story states that the gentleman stationed himself with sovereigns in a tea tray, and sold only two within the hour,—winning the bet. This tale the  fawney bouncers  tell the public, only offering brass, double gilt rings, instead of sovereigns.</p>
      <p> FAWNEY, or  fawney rig,  ring dropping. A few years ago, this practice, or  rig,  was very common. A fellow purposely dropped a ring, or a pocket book with some little articles of jewellery, &amp;c., in it, and when he saw any person pick it up, ran to claim half. The ring found, the question of how the booty was to be divided had then to be decided. The  Fawney  says, " if you will give me eight or nine shillings for my share the things are yours." This the  flat  thinks very fair. The ring of course is valueless, and the swallower of the bait discovers the trick too late.</p>

A person is said to be  flash  when he apes the appearance or manners of his betters, or when he is trying to be superior to his friends and relations.  Flash  also means " fast," roguish, and sometimes infers counterfeit or deceptive,—and this, perhaps, is its general signification.

      <p> GIGLAMPS, spectacles. In my first edition I stated this to be a  University  term. Mr.  Cuthbert Bede,  however, in a communication to  Notes and Queries,  of which I have availed myself in the present edition, says—" If the compiler has taken this epithet from  Verdant Green,  I can only say that I consider the word not to be a ' University' word in general, but as only due to the inventive genius of Mr. Bouncer in particular." The term, however, has been adopted, and is now in general use.</p>

I don't know that it has been elsewhere remarked, but most country districts in England have one or more families of the name of HODGE ; indeed,  giles  and  hodge  appear to be the favourite hobnail nomenclature. Not in any way writing disrespectfully, was the slang word taken from Hog—with the  g soft, which gives the  dg  pronunciation ? In old canting dictionaries  hoegb  stands for a country clown; so, indeed, does ROGER, another favourite provincial name. —  Vide Bacchus and  Fckm*.</p>
      <p> HOG, " to go the whole  hog,"  to do anything with a person's entire strength, not " by halves;" realised by the phrase " in for a penny in for a pound."  Bartlett  claims this to be a pure  American  phrase; whilst  Ker,  of course, gives it a Dutch  origin.— Old.</p>

"Tell that to the MARINES, the blue jackets won't believe it!" was a common rejoinder to a " stiff yarn." No w-a- days they are deservedly appreciated as the finest regiment in the service.

      <p> HUMBLE PIE, to " eat  humble pie,"  to knock under, be submissive. The UMBLES, or entrails of a deer, were anciently made into a dish for servants, while their masters feasted off the haunch.</p>
      <p> HUMBUG, an imposition, or a person who imposes upon others. A very expressive bub slang word, synonymous at one time with HUM AND HAW. Lexicographcrs have fought shy at adopting this word. Richardson uses it frequently to express the meining of other words, but omits it iu the alphabetical arrangement as unworthy of recognition! In the first edition of this work, 1785 was given as the earliest date at which the word could be found in a printed book. Since then I have traced  humbug  half a century farther back, on the title-page of a singular old jest-book—"  The Universal Jester;  or a pocket companion for the Wits : being a choice collection of merry conceits, facetious drolleries, &amp;c., clenchers, closers, closures, bon-mots, and humbugs,"  by  Ferdinaudo Killigrew.  London, about 1735-40.</p>
      <p> I have also ascertained that the famous Orator Henley was known to the mob as  Ouator Humbug.  The fact may be learnt from an illustration in that exceedingly curious little collection of  Caricatures,  published in 1757, many of which were sketched by Lord Bolingbroke—Horace Walpole filling in the names and explanations.  HalUwell  describes  humbuq as " a person who hums," and cites Dean Milles' MS., which was written about 1760. It has been stated that the word is a corruption of Hamburgh, from which town so many false bulletins and reports came during the war in the lass century. " Oh, that is  Hamburgh  [or  humbug],"  was the answer to any fresh piece of news which smacked of im-</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-158"/>
      <p> probability.  Orose  mentious it in his Dictionary, 1785 ; and in a little printed squib, published iu 1808, entitled  Bath Characters,  by  T. Goosequill,  humbug  is thus mentioned in a comical couplet on the title page :—</p>
      <p> " Wee Thre Bath Deities bee, Humbug,  Foilie, and Varietee."</p>
      <p> Gradually from this time the word began to assume a place in periodical literature, and in novels not written by squeamish or over-precise authors. In the preface to a flat, and, I fear, unprofitable poem, entitled,  TJie Reign  o/husibug, a Satire,  8vo., 1836, the author thus apologises for the use of the word—" I have used the term  humbug  to designate this principle [wretched sophistry of life generally], considering that it is now adopted into our language as much as the words  dunce, jockey, cheat, swindler,  &amp;c., which were formerly only colloquial terms." A correspondent, who in a late number of  Adersaria  ingeniously traced  bombast  to the inflated Doctor Paracelsus Bombast, considers that HUMBUG may, in like manner, be derived from  Homberg,  the distinguished chemist of the court of the Duke of Orleans, who, according to the following passage from Bishop Berkeley's " Siris," was an ardent and successful seeker after the philosopher's stone!</p>
      <p> " § 194.—Of this there cannot be abetter proof than the experiment of Monsieur Homberg,  who made gold op mbkcckt by  nr-TEODUciNG LIGHT INTO ITS PORES, but at Buch trouble and expense, that, I suppose, nobody will try the esperiment for profit. By this injunction of light and mercury, both bodies became fixed, and produced a third different to either, to wit, real gold. For the truth of which  fact  I refer to the memoirs of the French Aca lemy of Sciences."— Berlcdeii's Works,  vol. ii., p. 366, (Wright's edition).</p>
      <p> The universal use of this term is remarkable; in California there is a town called  Humbug Flat —a name which gives a significant hint of the acuteness of the first settler.</p>

      <p> JEW'S EYE, a popular simile for anything valuable. Probably a corruption of the  Italian,  gioje  ;  French,  jouaille,  a jewel. In ancient times, when a king was short of cash, he generally issued orders for so many  Jew's eyes,  or equivalent sums of money. The Jews preferred paying the ransom, although often very heavy. We thus realise the popularly believed origin of  Jew's eye.  Used by  Shales-pere.</p>

      <p> JOB, a short piece of work, a prospect of emjiloyment.  Johnson describes  job  as a low word, without etymology. It is, and was, however, a cant word, and a  job,  two centuries ago, was an arranged robbery. Even at the present day it is mainly confined to the streets, in the sense of employment for a short time. Amongst undertakers a  job  signifies a funeral; "to do a  job,"  conduct any one's funeral; "by the JOB,"  i.e..  piece work, as opposed to &lt;me-work. A  job in political phraseology is a Government office or contract, obtained by secret influence or favouritism.</p>

      <p> M</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-162"/>
      <p> Sir Robert Peel) from Joseph Hume, the late respected M.P. The explanation is thus given in  Hawkins' History of the Silver Coinage of England.</p>
      <p> "  These pieces are said to have owed their existence to the pressing instance of Mr. Hume, from whence they, for some time, bore the nickname of  jobys. As  they were very convenient to pay short cab fares, the Hon. M.P. was extremely unpopular with the drivers, who frequently received only  a groat  where otherwise they would have received a sixpence without any demand for change." The term originated with the London cabmen, who have invented many others.</p>

      <p> JOGUL, to play up, at cards or other game.     Spanish,  juoab.</p>

" Chuck a  jolly,"  literally translated, is to throw a shout or a good word.</p>

      <p> KICK, a sixpence; " two and a  kick,"  two shillings and sixpence. KICK, a pocket.</p>
      <p> KICK THE BUCKET, to die.  -Norfolk.  According to Forby, a metaphor tal;en from the descent of a well or mine, which is of course absurd. The Rev. E. S. Taylor supplies me with the following note from his MS. additions to the work of the East-Anglian lexicographer :—</p>
      <p> " The allusion is to the way in which a slanshtered pi» is hun^ up, viz., by passing the ends of a bent piece of woud behind the tendons of the hind legs, and so suspending it to a hook in a beam above.    This piece of wood is locally termed  a bucket,  and 80 by a coarse metaphor the phrase came to signify to die. Compare the Norfolk phrase " as wrong as a bucket." The natives of the West Indies have converted the expression into KICKERABOO. KICK-UP, a noise or disturbance. KICK UP, "to KICK UP a  row,"  to create a tumult.

      <p> KIDMEN'T, a pocket-handkerchief fastened to the pocket, and partially hung out to entrap thieves.</p>

      <p> KIDSMAX, one who trains boys to thieve and pick pockets successfully.</p>
      <p> KILKENNY CAT, a popular simile for a voracious or desperate animal or person, from the story of the two cats in that county, who are said to have fought ami bitten each other until a small portion of the tail of one of them alone remained.</p>
      <p> KILLING, bewitching, fascinating. The term is akin to the phrase " dressing to  death."</p>
      <p> KIMBO, or A KiMBO, holding the arms in a bent position from the body, and resting the hands upon the hips, in a bullying attitude. Said to be  from A scaEUBO, Italian;  but more probably from  klmbaw,  the old cant for beating, or bullying.— See Grose.</p>
      <p> KINCHIN, a child.— Old cant.  From the  German  diminutive* kindchen,  a baby.</p>
      <p> KINCHIN COVE, a man who robs children; a little man.— Ancient cant.</p>
      <p> KINGSMAN, the favourite coloured neckerchief of the coster-mongers. ' The women wear them thrown over their shoulders. With both sexes they are more valued than any other article of clothing. A coster's  caste,  or position, is at stake, he imagines, if his  kingsman  is not of the most approved pattern.    ^Yhen he fights, his  kingsman  is tied</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-165"/>
      <p> either around his waist as a beU, or as a garter around his leg. This very singular partiality for a peculiar coloured neckcloth was doubtless derived from the Gipseys, and probably refers to an Oriental taste or custom long forgotten by these vagabonds. A singular similarity of taste for certain colours exists amongst the Hindoos, Gipseys, and London costermongers. Red and yellow (or orange) are the great favourites, and in these hues the Hindoo selects his turban and his robe ; the Gipsey his breeches, and his wife her shawl or gown ; and the costermonger his plush waistcoat and favourite  kingsman.  Amongst either class, when a fight takes place, the greatest re£?ard is paid to the favourite coloured article of dress. The Hindoo lays aside his turban, the Gipsey folds up his scarlet breeches or coat, whilst the pugilistic costei-monger of Covent Garden or Billingsgate, as we have just seen, removes his favourite neckerchief to a part of his body, by the rules of the " ring," comparatively out of danger. Amongst the various patterns of kerchiefs worn by the wandering tribes of London, red and yellow are the oldest and most in fashion. Bine, intermixed with spots, is a late importation, probably from the Navy, through sporting characters.</p>

      <p> KNOCK-IN, the game of  loo.</p>
      <p> KNOCK-OUTS, or  knock-ins,  disreputable persons who visit auction rooms and unite to buy the articles at their own prices. One of their number is instructed to buy for the rest, and after a few small bids as blinds to the auctioneer and bystanders, the lot is knocked down to the  knock-out bidders, at a nominal price—the competition to result from an auction being thus frustrated and set aside. At the conclusion of the sale the goods are paid for, and carried to some neighbouring public house, where they are re-sold or KNOCKED-OUT, and the difference between the first purchase and the second—or tapi'oom  knock-out  — is divided amongst the gang. As generally happens with iU-gotten gains, the money soon finds its way to the landlord's pocket, and the  knock-out  is rewarded with a red nose or a bloated face. Cunning tradesmen join the  knock-outs  when an opportunity for money making presents itself. The lowest description of  knock-outs,  fellows with more tongue than capital, are termed  babes, —which see.</p>
